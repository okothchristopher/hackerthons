## Problem Statement

A leading pet adoption agency is planning to create a virtual tour experience for their customers showcasing all animals that are available in their shelter. 
To enable this tour experience, you are required to build a Machine Learning model that determines type and breed of the animal based on its physical attributes and other factors.

## Steps I took
1. Cleaned the data - ie dates and removed outliers using isolatio forests 
2. Corrected target output class imbalance using SMOTE- Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
3. Compared different machine learning models ie Random Forest , XGboost and other linear based models,XGboost perfomed significantly better in predicting breed cateegory while RF was better in predicting pet category 
4. Tuned the Xg boost and RF model parameters to achieve and improved model prediction
